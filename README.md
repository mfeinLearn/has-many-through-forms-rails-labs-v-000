# Has Many Through Forms Rails Labs

## Overview

We are just practicing how to build out a Nested Form to get a better understanding on how it actually works.

## Objectives
1. Look at how we construct the view to get the layout to look like what we want.
2. Look at how the controller is constructed to see where the form data goes after the user submits the form.
3. Look at the Post and Category models and see how they are associated with each other as well as see how we apply put accepts_nested_attributes_for to the post model. 
## Instructions

Check it out and see how a basic nested form work!
